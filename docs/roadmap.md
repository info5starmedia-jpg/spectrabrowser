# Roadmap

## P1 — Engine distribution (next)
- Signed, checksummed Camoufox installer command (`spectra engine install`)
  with explicit consent, hash pinning and offline support.
- Engine health probe endpoint (version, launch self-test).

## P2 — Web dashboard
- React console served by the API itself: profiles grid, proxy manager,
  live status over the existing SSE stream. No separate hosting.

## P3 — Automation depth
- Playwright/Puppeteer connection helpers returned by start (library mode).
- Script runner (user JS/Python against a profile), warmup recorder.

## P4 — Own engine track
- Evaluate a Chromium fork with a quilt patch series (navigator, canvas,
  WebGL, WebRTC, fonts), each patch paired with a runtime verification
  script in `core/verify/`, run in CI against public checkers
  (CreepJS, sannysoft, pixelscan-class surfaces). Detection regression blocks
  release, exactly like a failing test.

## P5 — Team mode
- Optional self-hosted sync server: encrypted profile bundles, profile
  locking, role-based access. Local-first remains the default forever.

## P6 — Secrets hardening
- Proxy passwords and cookies move from SQLite to the OS keychain
  (DPAPI / Keychain / libsecret) behind a `SecretStore` port.

## Open decision items
- **D-002**: PID-reuse hardening — store per-platform process start tokens
  (Windows: process creation time; Linux: `/proc/<pid>/stat` starttime) so
  recovery can prove identity, not just liveness.
- **D-003**: Proxy rotation links (per-launch endpoint refresh) — design owed.
